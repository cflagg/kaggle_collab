# kaggle_collab
A repo for collaborating on Kaggle challenges. 

# Goals
1. Exposure to different types of data and data analysis challenges. 
2. Exposure to how different people approach the same problem. 
3. A testing ground for exploring how to collaborate on data analysis and coding projects i.e.: 
  * How do we split up tasks?
  * Can a coding/data analysis project/problem achieve goals more quickly by distributing tasks?

# Directory Structure

1. One folder at the root for separate Kaggle challenges
2. Sub-folders divided by content:
  * Data
  * Scripts
  * Note
  * Relevant Literature
  * etc. 

# Collaboration 
* Express and organize thoughts in the "Issues" section of the GitHub page
* Use the Wiki for sharing knowledge and thoughts that spans across potential projects (i.e. dplyr::%>% does this)
* Try to use Markdown whenever possible
